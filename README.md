This is my 3rd year Backend Project 

For Consumers (Drivers):
Find Nearby Parking: The app allows users to quickly locate available parking spaces based on their location, preferences, and needs (e.g., pricing, duration, covered parking, etc.).
Real-Time Availability: It likely offers real-time data on parking spot availability, reducing the time spent searching for parking.
Reservations: Consumers can potentially reserve parking spots ahead of time, ensuring a space is ready when they arrive.

For Parking Providers (Owners, Operators):
Automation: Park+ helps automate processes like booking, payments, and space management, reducing manual effort for parking providers.
Real-Time Data & Insights: Parking providers can track parking spot occupancy and demand trends, helping them optimize pricing and capacity.
Enhanced Management Tools: Providers can manage reservations, availability, and pricing directly through the app.
Revenue Maximization: Through dynamic pricing models, parking operators can potentially increase their revenue by adjusting rates based on demand.
Security & Monitoring: The app could include features for monitoring parking lot security (e.g., camera integration, automated access control) to ensure a safe environment.

Benefits:
For Consumers: Saves time and reduces frustration of finding parking, offers a more organized and convenient parking experience.
For Providers: Increases efficiency, reduces operational costs, and potentially boosts revenue by offering a more user-friendly and data-driven service.
